# LWPP initialization

This repository contains the implementation of Low-Weigth Pauli Propagation initialization, as described in our manuscript: [arXiv:2508.06358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06358). Benchmarking this strategy on Heisenberg models, we demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in both the final accuracy and convergence rate.
